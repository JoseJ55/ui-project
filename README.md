# UI Practice Project

## Description
This project is based on the project totorial by [JavaScript
Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) on their
youtube video ["Build and Deploy a Fully Responsive Modern UI/UX Website in
React JS"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMagNcngvcU). As practice I tried to
build the project alone and then review the video to see the differences.
Between what I did and the person did. Most of the difference were minor, but
the totrial help show me another way to align content better and a more
structured way of getting images and files when there is a lot of them.

## Summary
I used this project to improve my skills and compare how I do things to someone
else's way. I believe this can help since I can see what is more effiecent and
change my coding style and incorporate them to what I know. In this totorial I
was able to see a new way to structure my files in React.js to orginize
components being called and images or other assets that are needed in the file.
I was also able to compare my use of flex in css where I didn't stretch and
utilie the space correctly. I knew about the way it was used since I often use
it in React Native, but I did not realy incorporated it in my normal React.js
projects.
